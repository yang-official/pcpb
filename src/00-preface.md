# Preface
Coding problems are, for better or worse, currently a necessary part of life for software engineers, whether professional, amateur, or aspiring.

The problems in this book are largely derived from online archives such as leetcode and hackerrank; sources are identified where possible.

This book is intended to be a pure problem book. Therefore, it does not contain detailed introductory materials. It is neither complete nor self-contained. Some familiarity with algorithms and data structures, Big O notation, and other computer science concepts are assumed. Though readers may use this book as a resource in preparing for coding interviews, its focus is not on coding interviews themselves, and therefore does not discuss interview and problem solving strategies.

The solutions presented in this book are by no means the only way to solve these problems; developing alternative solutions are possible and even encouraged. This is especially true for system design problems, which are intentionally open ended. All solutions are written in Python, avoiding library imports as much as possible, and verified by online testing (leetcode, hackerrank, etc.) wherever possible. Solutions are intended to be “practical” rather than “elegant,” as in they are intended to be similar to solutions that a student would produce under time pressure, such as if asked to solve the problem in an interview. Solutions are provided immediately after problems to allow quick reference without tedious flipping of pages, though of course readers are encouraged to attempt to write their own solution before consulting the provide solution.
