# Preface
SQL coding problems are, for better or worse, currently a necessary part of life for database engineers and administrators, whether professional, amateur, or aspiring.

The problems in this book are largely derived from online archives such as leetcode and hackerrank; sources are identified where possible.

This book is intended to be a pure problem book. Therefore, it does not contain detailed introductory materials. It is neither complete nor self-contained. Some familiarity with SQL, relational databases, and related concepts are assumed. Though readers may use this book as a resource in preparing for SQL coding interviews, its focus is not on interviews themselves, and therefore does not discuss interview and problem solving strategies.

The solutions presented in this book are by no means the only way to solve these problems; developing alternative solutions are possible and even encouraged. All solutions are written in ANSI SQL, and verified by online testing (leetcode, hackerrank, etc.) wherever possible. Solutions are intended to be “practical” rather than “elegant,” as in they are intended to be similar to solutions that a student would produce under time pressure, such as if asked to solve the problem in an interview. Solutions are provided immediately after problems to allow quick reference without tedious flipping of pages, though of course readers are encouraged to attempt to write their own solution before consulting the provide solution.
